					<br>   <p>

							International long-haul flights have been a painful process
							 for a long time.
							Long flights sparked an interest for delving into the unique
							 issues of plan rides and
							creating technology for this social environment. People often
							 find themselves bored and
							wasting their time on the plane, which inspired us to think
							 the question - how might we
							improve the experience on an airplane and allow people to do
							 something more meaningful? 
							<br>
							<br>
							Our team was tasked to invent, prototype, and evaluate a
							 novel social computing experience that
							 is functional and a co-located, synchronous interaction for
							 a group setting. 
							 Through group-prototyping, iterations, and feedback, we
								worked to provide a unique social
							 experience that alleviates the painful process of long
							 haul flights, as well as connecting
							 passengers on the plane. </p>         </p>

										Prototype Version 1</h3>
        					<p>
                    <br>
										To understand our social setting, we conducted
										qualitative research through in-person
										 interviews and surveys, online research, and
										 competitive analysis. We were able to find
											general trends through our participants’ answers.  On our first iteration, we built a functional prototype using Google Spreadsheets,
                		Google Forms, and Google Maps. Through storytelling, we described our social
                		 context to our participants, and asked them to play specific roles (of visitors
                		  and locals). We provided them with detailed instructions of what to do and how
                			 to use our ‘Minimal Viable Prototype’ to interact with each other through the
                			 system, and lastly created a survey to get feedback. The emergent behavior
                			 we were hoping to see was an instructional scaffolding for local culture,
                			 points of interests, and other relevant information between local residents
                			 and visitors, and an increase in the amount of social interaction between
                			 passengers. We were looking for indicators such as the users successfully
                			  accomplishing the tasks without encountering many slips/mistakes, their
                				 positive feedback when reviewing our idea, and a successful acquisition of
                				  interesting information that wasn’t previously available.  Although we got
                					some positive reviews such as the originality and value of adding Google Maps
                					to our MVP, our main critique was that while visitors would be interested
                					on it, locals wouldn’t have any incentive to participate on our app.

					Iteration</h3>
        <p>
    <br>
      To improve the weaknesses of our first prototype, we iterated with the objective
     to focus more on the overall experience rather than making an information-focused
     app, since that could already be found on travel guides and it would be only
    valuable to visitors. In that way, we decided to add a fun quiz (based on the
     popular Buzzfeed ones) to our app that both locals and visitors could play
      and would be entertained with. We also improved on the aspect of our app by
  	creating graphic screens using Sketch that would resemble those of an airline,
   and implement them with our game.</p>

							Prototype Version 2</h3>        <p>
      <br>
        In our second version of our prototype, people would take the “Buzzfeed styled quiz”,
    	 find the location pin based off their quiz results on the map provided, and
  	 successfully be able to speak with people in the chatroom to coordinate travel
   plans or start casual conversation about the destination they’re headed to.  When
   prototyping, we asked users to first take the quiz, and afterwards
   we explained the motives behind the quiz. Based on a users preference to
 certain pictures of food, places, hotels, etc the quiz result outputted an
 ‘ideal itinerary’ for that user’s responses.</p>

    <div class="fh5co-project-service">
            <p> <br>  <br> <br>  From there, we incorporated our
          GoogleMaps feature by having a link that led the user to a map of their ideal
        itinerary locations, so that they could see where everything was in proximity
        to each other. Users were also able to see the rest of the plane passengers’
        itineraries but checking and unchecking the side panel results on the left-hand side.
           We also provided a GoogleDoc that allowed passengers to use the chat room to
        interact with each other and discuss their results.</p>

																			Conclusion </h3>
																			<p>
																				<br>
																				Overall, our feedback from our second prototype was more positive than our
															        	previous version. Users found our prototype to be more fun and more simple in
															        	our second trial, and the BuzzFeed video was overall a success, as one user
															        	quoted “I enjoyed how you used pictures and the quiz. I liked seeing the different
															        	foods and places, all while it being very informative.” While prototyping,
															        	we observed users smiling and chuckling when opening up the quiz which we
															        	interpreted as a sign that they found the quiz enjoyable to some degree. Users
															        	did suggest having more options available on the map and allowing users to
															        	edit their itinerary. One user commented “I liked seeing the legend and the
															        	 many destinations, however one of my locations was very far from the rest
															        	  and I wanted the ability to drag that point and replace it with someone
															        		else’s attraction.”  Additionally, users wanted the tool to suggest passengers
															        		 to connect with based on mutual points of interest and other conversation
															        		 starters-all which our team would hypothetically look forward to in our next
															        		  iteration. One user suggested having less people in the chat room because
															        			“imagining having 100 people in a single chat room would get overwhelming.”
															        			Due to our small testing population, we combined all users into a single
															        			 group chat to avoid the potential problem of only one or two users being
															        			 separated into a chat room by themselves. However, if we did have a larger
															        			  testing group we would separate the chat rooms instead by grouping users
															        				together based on common itineraries from their quiz results.
