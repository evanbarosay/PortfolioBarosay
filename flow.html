  My Role 	     </h2>
                              <h4 class="minititles">UX Researcher, UI Specialist, Project Lead</h4>

      					<p>
                  As one of the UX Researcher, I helped gather critical user
                  information so that we could direct our project while addressing user needs.
                  We used surveys and interviews to collect data.
<br> <br>
                    As the user interface specialist, I overlooked the overall design for
                    each aspect of the project, from logos to wireframes to
                high fidelity prototypes.
                This projects was the first I took part of the UI, whereas in the past
                I take charge of research mainly.
                    <br> <br>
                    As the Lead, I managed the project and team to ensure that
                    we were on track and completing deadlines. I faciliated assigning
                     tasks and kept others accountable.  </a>    <br> <br>                    </p>

                        <p>
                          Flow is a high-fidelity prototype developed in an usability and
                           information architecture class (COGS 187A). Our app goal was to make group work more enjoyable
                            and fair with our three main features: accountability, equal work, and collaboration.

                                    lead us to an effective and popular application.</p>

                                            our target users.  We created multiple personas and
                                            storyboards to define our user audience.
                                          </p>

                                          <p>  We were then able to move on to create a low-fidelity prototype. Using a whiteboard and
                                            then sketch paper,
                                             we created multiple variations of our app idea.
                                            Our team focused on creating an effortless flow of our app, to aide new users with navigating the app.                    </p>

                    <p>
                      To gain more feedback, we gave a class-presentation of our personas, storyboards, and low-fidelity prototype.
                       We gained valuable insight from our peers that we failed to recognize, for example, how
                       our app varied from Trello or Slack. This had us go back to the white board
                       to fix some critical errors before we jumped into user-testing.</p>

                    <h4 class="minititles"><br>User Testing</h4>
                    <p>
                      To user-test, our team split up into two groups and collaborated with another group of peers. From the feedback we recieved,
                      we realized that the
                       icons we chose and the navigation that we created were not as clear or intuitive to other users. Users complained that
                        the visualization of task completion was too confusing. Using colors to denote status resulted in
                        multiple subjective readings and users found the navigation between screens to be unintuitive. Furthermore,
                       we learned about features that people wanted, such as a better way to communicate via comments and activity logs.

                   <h4 class="minititles"><br> Feedback </h4>
<p>
  From our inital low-fidelity prototype user-testing, we had a list of factors to iterate on.
  Our main points to focus on were having unique features to stand apart from
  competing applications, overall navigation, and clearer icons and colors.
      </p>

                   <h4 class="minititles"><br> Version 2</h4>
<p>
  After a few brainstorming sessions, we decided that our main pillars to make our app unique in the market
  would be accountability, equal work, and collaboration. We added a rating feature to each task. By rating the difficulty of each task,
  the app can calculate the amount of work that needs to be done by each user to result in a roughly even d
  istribuition of work. Users who had done less work would see their score in relation to others in the group,
   and would feel the social pressure to balance the spread. We also added a chat feature to open up ways of
   team collaboration through the app. We additionally changed icons and the color coding on the task page
   so it was more inline with a user's mental model.

                                    <h4 class="minititles">Wrapping Up </h4> <p>  After getting the main functionalities and unique characteristics settled, we focused on creating an appealing
                                      UI and implementing a final high-fidelity prototype.
                                       We used Sketch to create our interface design.
                                       Our final version of Flow was a high-fidelity
                                       prototype that allowed users to log in and
                                       access group projects they were currently
                                       tasked with. Users would be able to add
                                        teammates to a project and distribute tasks.
                                        As an individual user is assigned more tasks,
                                        there is an indicator on their profile to show how
                                        much of the project they are responsible for.
                                        We hope this feature would help as users
                                        continue to distribute tasks, so that they would
                                        recognize when certain teammates have more
                                        work than others. We also had a chat feature
                                        so that the team does not to navigate away
                                        from our application to communicate
                                        about the project.
                                    Using an online deployer, we were able to upload
                                    our Sketch interfaces and add interaction and functionalities to the screens.
                                  Take a look!  </p>
