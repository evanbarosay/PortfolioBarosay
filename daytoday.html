      <p>
      <br>  Our team was tasked to design a technolgoy that brought
      users joy, rather than frustration, in the
      field of 'accessibility'. DayToday is an app geared for children with
      learning disabilties. After user research at a local elementary school,
    we learned that many of these children have difficulty completing day to day
  tasks and often get distracted or overwhelmed. Our app is designed to help users
focus on individual tasks, one at a time.   </p>

                    <h4 class="minititles">UX Researcher, UI Designer, Programmer</h4>
                    <p>
            Due  to our small team, all members took responsibility and tasks along every step of the process.
            I specifically conducted user-interviews with people with learning disabilties and
            teachers, created paper prototypes and low-fidelity Sketch designs, and used
            HTML and CSS for basic formatting, as well as JavaScript to implement features such as
            the individual scrolling through tasks on the home page.

        Needfinding 	     </h2>
       <p>  To better define our root problem and point of view,
          our team used user-research methods to gain a clearer
           perspective on the path of our project. Research
           included competitive analysis,
           observational resesarch, interviews, storyboards,
            and personas. We interviewed from potential user groups, including
             teachers that worked with children with learning disabilties
            as well as adults with focusing problems.  We asked about how a young child
            navigates their everyday life and what unique struggles they run into.
             The answers to the interview questions allowed us to gain insights about
              and empathize with who I was designing. From here, we created storyboards
            of potential users and how they could use our app idea and established
            our point of view: Managing oneâ€™s
            time in a schedule is unorganized and easily forgettable.
            Time is easier to manage when everything is laid out in a clear,
            memorable, and referable way.
             Planning a productive and efficient schedule to keep one on task
              throughout their week should be
             an automated and seamless process. .</p>

							Prototyping and User Testing</h3>        <p>
      <br>
      To flesh out our ideas, we created experience prototypes for user testing.
      Because our target users are a
        younger audience, we tried to test with kids and users who interact with
         children commonly. At first, we created
        paper prototypes and iterated upon the paper prototypes to understand the best
        flow of our app. We also used Wizard-of-Oz prototyping in user testing with peers
        to test our flow, navigation, and current design. We also used
         heuristic evaluations and in-person interviews to consolidate
         our general characteristics and feedback of
          the UI. We moved on to a digital prototype by deploying our
          interface to Heroku. We implemented our suggested improvements
          to address major usability problems.</p>

            <br>
          One of the major motivations for this app was to condense
          the information the user is receiving so they don't feel
          overwhelmed. We wanted to display one task at a time, however from
          feedback, we found out users still want access to their entire list
          of tasks. As a result, we A/B tested the home screen with a single displayed task
           versus one task displayed with the abilitiy to scroll right and
           left through the entire list. Version B (scrolling function)
          was far more popular and became a permanent feature in the prototype.</p>

  Finale 	     </h2>
  <p>    After analyzing our results, we deployed our final version of our mobile-web app: DayToday.
     We also did a presentation on
   DayToday to UCSD teaching assistants and
  professors, as well as local professionals in the field. DayToday is an
  app that helps users tackles daily tasks one at a time. Its main feature
   is displaying only one task and its visual on the screen. The visual reminder
    helps to make tasks more tangible and engaging for our target users, who are children.
    To view all tasks, users use the arrows to scroll through. Additionally,
    the app keeps track of how many tasks the user has accomplished to give
     a sense of accomplishment.
