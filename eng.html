					<p>
          <br>  Global Ties is an innovative, humanitarian engineering program
            of the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego. Accepted  teams
            are given a non-profit organization to work with and address
             their problem(s). I had the humbling opportunity to work alongside
            10 other applicants and help Es Por Los Ni単os, a HIV/AIDS
             clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The clinic helps mothers and children with
            HIV/AIDS attain medicine, counseling, and multiple other
            resources. However, the clinic realized many kids were not
            taking their medication-a major health hazard. Our journey
            with Es Por Los Ni単os led us to creating an app, specific
            to this organization and their needs.                    </p>

                  In-depth user research was critical for this project. I took charge of UX research
                  to guarentee that our team understood our users, the children and mothers in
                  Tijuana. I conducted in-person interviews with pediatricians and
                  associated professionals in the field of AIDS/HIV, held Skype calls
                  with the founder to get her insight on major steps we were making,
                and  organized trips down
                  to Mexico to observe the clinic and the user-environment and conduct
                  user-testing.

                    <h4 class="minititles">Background</h4>
                    <p>
        We entered this project knowing a fair amount about our stakeholder.
        Es Por Los Ni単os is a non-profit organization that supports children, woman and adolescents
         living with HIV/AIDS in Tijuna, Mexico.
        The founder, Rosalva Martha-Patten, started the foundation in memory of her son
  . The organization works to prevent HIV transmission and provide support to families.
  They have medical clinics and doctors associated to prescribe medication, however Rosalva
  began to notice a problem with the children in terms of medication intake. She had been looking
  for a method to incentivize the kids to take their medication.

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="minititles">Target Audience - Affected Mother & Children</h4>
                    <p>
Our main users in this scenario are the affected chilren. However, mothers are also not only
affected and use the resources at Es Por Los Ni単os, but they are also supervising
the children on a day-to-day basis. We wanted to be sure to keep in mind both the mother and
child when designing since they would both be in interaction with the finalized app.
Key features we knew we needed included: Android-based (almost all users owned Androids),
an app that was in fluent Spanish, and AIDS/HIV focused.    </p>

					<p>
                      To delve deeper into the root problem, our team conducted in-person
                      and Skype interviews with a variety of stakeholders.

We interviewed a diverse group of interviewees and gained valuable insight. Below is a
brief summary of main findings we gained from our user research. Our team was
able to reevaluate and create our problem statement: Youth and adolescents in
Tijuana aware of their HIV or AIDS diagnosis need motivation and communal support
to foster consistent medical compliance because they are exposed to social stigma
that restricts their education and awareness of their diagnosis, as well as
prevents them from receiving life-long treatment.<br>

fall into resistance which requires more medication and more usage.                  </p>

                    <p> Our user research gave us more information to assess what
                      our root problem was. We needed to create a tool
                      that was HIV/AIDS specific, in Spanish, and reminded users
                      to take their medication. On top of that, we also needed to address that
                      our users felt overwhelmed and stigmatized by society,
                      the tool should be discrete and not obviously about the disease,
                       include an incentive so that users continue to use the app,
                       and provide support and education to all users.

We had a few holdbacks on this project. First, we had to realize that our main
target audience was in another country, which limited accessibility for user-testing. Thus,
we had to find similar users that were closer to our team and availability.
Secondly, no one on our team had designed on Android platforms before. Myself and two
other teammates took 'crash-courses' to understand how we can program and use
Android tools to develop the app. We also had about 5 weeks to completely
program a working app, so not all functionalities became a reality.
Lastly, we had to use Spanish in the app. Thankfully,
one teammate was a fluent speaker and was able to translate all of our text.</p>

      We used Android Studio and Sketch to flesh out our ideas and come up
            with possible paths we could take with our app. Our main challenge was finding
            a way to incentivize users to come back to the app. We thought of using a game,
            rewards/points system, and journal to do so. After some in-class evaluations, we decided
            to implement a system of unlocking achievements based on a user's 'streak' of medication-intake.

     <p>
       After our first prototype was completed, we scheduled a trip to Tijuana
       to user-test with the participants at Es Por Los Ni単os. A group of our team
       was able to make the trip and document the findings and observations.
       We found from the trip that the app was easy to use and understand, and there
       was overall a positive reaction with all users that tested our app. The
       mothers enjoyed the journal feature, and the children were excited about
       the challenge to unlock all the trophies. However,
       we realized there is no way to guarntee a user takes the medication because
       there is no verification system in place. We also decided we wanted to add an education
       factor to the app so users were able to learn more about the disease in a
       fun way.

<p> La Capsula de La Vida, named after the suggestions from the kids in Tijuana,
  serves a medication-reminder app for the mothers and children affected with
  AIDS/HIV. Our simple design allows users to input their
  personal medical data, while still being discrete. After entering the name of the
  prescribed medication and the dosage, users can use either the analog or
  digital clock to set their reminder time. A calendar documents the medication usage
  and also denote any comments or journal entries made. When a user marks that they
  have taken their medication at the reminder-time, a follow-up question asks them
  about their mood (mood swings can be a serious side effect that doctors need to know about).
  Lastly, we have our educational story that uses a kid-friendly character to
  briefly explain the importance of medication for AIDS/HIV, as well as the
  ahievements a user can unlock. <br>
  This opportunity was both humbling and eye-opening. Being able to design is an
  enjoyment of mine, but being able to design a product or tool for people who
  really need help was more than fulfilling. Our team was able to present our
  work, and the founder Rosalva came to here. Seeing how excited she was for this
  app and the kind words she shared about the experiences that the mother and children
  had made this entire process more than worth it. Being able to work with Es Por
  Los Ni単os opened my eyes to what I can truly use my design skills for. I hope
  I will have future opportunities to assist others in need.
